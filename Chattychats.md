# Overview of the MVP
1- Data Collection: The software will allow canvassers to collect data at each door they knock on. This could include whether someone answered, their response (e.g., not interested, renter, already has solar), and any notes or additional information.

2- Data Utilization: The data collected will be used to:
    - Avoid knocking on doors that are unlikely to be interested in the future (e.g., renters, those who recently installed solar).
    - Prioritize doors that showed potential interest or where homeowners might be more likely to consider solar in the future.
    - Provide insights for canvassers before knocking, such as the likely decision-maker's age, household energy consumption, or other relevant factors.

3- Performance Tracking and Optimization: On the company side, the software will provide dashboards to:
    - Track team and individual performance.
    - Identify effective canvassing strategies and pitches.
    - Highlight areas with high potential for lead generation.

4- Integration with Mapping Tools: The software will integrate with Google Maps or similar services to help canvassers visualize their routes and highlight high-potential areas.

# High-Level Plan for Developing the MVP

## 1. Define the Core Features and Data Structure

**Description**:  
Determine the essential features for the MVP, such as data collection, route mapping, and basic analytics. Decide on the data you need to collect (e.g., homeowner response, contact details, notes, etc.) and how this data will be structured and stored.

- **Programming Language**: Python (for backend logic and data handling).
- **Feasibility with Python**: Yes, Python is well-suited for data manipulation and backend logic.
- **Required Topics**:
  - Basic Python syntax (variables, loops, conditionals)
  - Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
  - File handling (reading and writing data)
- **Considerations**: Start simple. Focus on a small set of data fields and ensure you can store and retrieve this data effectively.

## 2. Develop the Backend Logic for Data Handling

**Description**:  
Build the core functionality to handle data collection, storage, and retrieval. This includes creating functions to add new entries, update existing ones, and query data.

- **Programming Language**: Python.
- **Feasibility with Python**: Yes, Python is ideal for building the backend logic.
- **Required Topics**:
  - Functions and modules (to organize code)
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) basics (if using classes to structure data and operations)
  - Error handling and debugging (to manage user input errors and system failures)
- **Considerations**: Focus on writing clean, reusable functions. You can use Python libraries like `pandas` for more advanced data handling and manipulation.

## 3. Create a Basic User Interface (UI)

**Description**:  
Develop a simple UI to allow canvassers to input data and view information. Start with a command-line interface (CLI) for simplicity, then consider a graphical user interface (GUI) or a basic web interface.

- **Programming Language**:  
  - Python (CLI or GUI using libraries like `tkinter`)
  - HTML/CSS and JavaScript (for a basic web interface)
- **Feasibility with Python**:  
  - CLI/GUI: Yes, fully feasible with Python.
  - Web Interface: Python is used for the backend (using frameworks like Flask or Django), while HTML/CSS/JavaScript is required for the front end.
- **Required Topics**:
  - For CLI: Python basics (input/output handling)
  - For GUI: `tkinter` basics (widgets, event handling)
  - For Web Interface: Basics of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), web frameworks (Flask/Django)
- **Considerations**: Start with a CLI to simplify development. Once comfortable, you can transition to a more sophisticated GUI or web interface.

## 4. Integrate with Google Maps API

**Description**:  
Use the Google Maps API to enable route mapping and visualization for canvassers. This step involves fetching map data and displaying it based on the input.

- **Programming Language**: Python (backend logic to interact with the API), JavaScript (if using a web-based frontend to display maps).
- **Feasibility with Python**: Partially. Python can handle API requests, but JavaScript is needed for web-based map interactions.
- **Required Topics**:
  - API usage and handling in Python (`requests` library)
  - Basic understanding of RESTful APIs and JSON
  - JavaScript (for web integration with Google Maps)
- **Considerations**: Learn how to authenticate and make requests to the Google Maps API. Understand how to handle JSON responses and parse data.

## 5. Implement Basic Data Analytics and Visualization

**Description**:  
Develop simple analytics to track performance metrics (e.g., conversion rates, door knock success rates) and visualize this data.

- **Programming Language**: Python (data analytics and visualization).
- **Feasibility with Python**: Yes, Python is great for data analytics using libraries like `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
- **Required Topics**:
  - Data manipulation (`pandas` library)
  - Data visualization (`matplotlib` or `seaborn` libraries)
- **Considerations**: Focus on key metrics that will provide immediate value. Keep visualizations simple and clear.

## 6. Develop a Simple Database or Data Storage Solution

**Description**:  
Decide on a data storage solution for saving canvasser input and results. Start with a simple file-based storage (CSV or JSON) or a lightweight database like SQLite.

- **Programming Language**: Python (to interact with the storage solution).
- **Feasibility with Python**: Yes, fully feasible with Python.
- **Required Topics**:
  - File handling (reading and writing to CSV/JSON)
  - SQL basics (if using SQLite)
  - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) basics (if using frameworks like Django with its built-in ORM)
- **Considerations**: Begin with file-based storage for simplicity. As your data grows, consider transitioning to a database.

## 7. Deploy the MVP for Testing

**Description**:  
Deploy your MVP to a small group of users (e.g., a team of canvassers) for testing and feedback. Choose a deployment method based on your UI choice (CLI/GUI for local use, web app for broader access).

- **Programming Language**: Python (for backend deployment scripts, if needed).
- **Feasibility with Python**: Yes, fully feasible with Python.
- **Required Topics**:
  - Basic knowledge of hosting and deployment (local server setup for CLI/GUI or cloud deployment for web apps)
  - Version control (using Git for managing code versions)
- **Considerations**: Gather user feedback and focus on iterative improvements. Ensure you have a basic understanding of version control and deployment practices.

## Additional Tips

- **Start Small**: Focus on building and perfecting a few core features first. You can expand and add more complex functionalities later.
- **Use Version Control**: Keep your code organized and manage changes using Git.
- **Leverage Libraries and Frameworks**: Don't reinvent the wheel. Utilize Python libraries and frameworks to speed up development.
- **Learn as You Go**: You'll inevitably face challenges and need to learn new concepts. Use these opportunities to deepen your understanding.
