# Features
Here is a more detailed list of the core feature that the software will have.

## Data Collection
The software will have the ability to record information from door-to-door interactions collected by the canvassers.
The initial data that will be collected will be divided in Mandatory and Optional.

**Mandatory**
- Address
- Timestamp (time of contact)
- Prospect response: it represents the answer (if any) of the potential prospect. This data is subdivided in the following subcategories:
    - No answer
    - Direct no (Homeowner)
    - Direct no (Renters)
    - Return later
    - Initial conversations
    - Detailed conversations
    - Appointments set
    - Undefined
- Reason of 'no' (if any): if the prospects says no, it can be useful to understand why. Below are some of the main reasons collected so far, that would be useful to keep track of to eventually adapt the offer:
    - Already got solar panels on rooftop
    - Does not make economical sense
    - Electricity bill is already low
    - Cannot get incentives from government
    - Busy at the moment
    - Too old
    - Very steep rooftop
    - Rooftop to renovate first
    - Does not trust door knocking people
    - Soon selling the house

**Optional**
- Electricity bill estimate (if provided)
- Approximate age
- Presumed gender
- Presumed family status (single, married,...)
- Solar panels on roof (Y/N)
- House characteristics (e.g., with swimming pool, sunny area, partial shadowing from trees)
- Interest level
- Any additional notes / comments from the canvasser
